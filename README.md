## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get Fortura up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (latest LTS recommended)
-   React Native CLI installed globally (`npm install -g react-native-cli`)
-   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android Emulator/Device setup) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS Simulator/Device setup on macOS)
-   A Firebase project with Phone Authentication enabled and configured for your app (add your `google-services.json` for Android or `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS).
-   A Google Cloud Project with access to the Gemini API (configure your API key in the app).

### Steps to Clone and Run the Project

1.  **Clone a specific branch of the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone --single-branch --branch RNCfortura [https://github.com/pratyush090506/fortura_ver1.git](https://github.com/pratyush090506/fortura_ver1.git) Newfortura
    cd Newfortura
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    * Add your `google-services.json` file to the `android/app` directory.
    * Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the `ios/<YourAppName>` directory and ensure it's added to your Xcode project.

4.  **Configure Gemini API:**
    * Add your Gemini API key to the appropriate place in the code (e.g., a `.env` file or a config constant, make sure not to commit keys directly).

5.  **Start Metro bundler:**

    ```sh
    npx react-native start
    ```
    Keep this terminal running.

6.  **Run the app on an emulator or device:**

    * **For Android:**
        ```sh
        npx react-native run-android
        ```
        Ensure that an emulator is running, or a device is connected with USB debugging enabled.
    * **For iOS (Mac only):**
        ```sh
        npx react-native run-ios
        ```
        Ensure Xcode is installed and configured, and you have installed CocoaPods if needed (`cd ios && pod install`).

### Troubleshooting

-   If the app does not start or you encounter environment issues, run the React Native doctor:
    ```sh
    npx react-native doctor
    ```
-   If there are dependency issues or caching problems, try cleaning the cache and rebuilding:
    ```sh
    npm start -- --reset-cache
    # Then re-run the platform-specific command (npx react-native run-android or npx react-native run-ios)
    ```
-   Ensure your Firebase project is correctly set up for the specific platform (SHA-1 fingerprints for Android, Bundle Identifier for iOS).
